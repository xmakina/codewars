                            <p> In a recent technical interpretation (2016-0642811E5, June 29, 2016), the CRA suggests that it may apply GAAR to a prescribed rate spousal loan arrangement (described in the TI) if it can be shown that &quot;the primary purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the transactions was to reduce the tax liability of the taxpayer or the [taxpayer's] spouse.&quot; The CRA says that the purpose of such a transaction cannot be determined until it thoroughly reviews the facts of the situation in question. </p>
                            <p> When an individual resident in Canada transfers capital property to his or her spouse who is also resident in Canada, the capital property is deemed to have been disposed of for proceeds equal to the property's ACB immediately before the transfer, and to have been acquired for that amount under subsection 73(1)

Any post-transfer income or gain from the property is deemed to be the transferor's income or gain under the attribution rule in subsection 74.1(1)

                                <a title="CPA Canada’s Knotia" target="_blank" href="http://www.tax.ca/qf/ITA%2074.2(1)?sid=CTF" class="CICA" alt="CPA Canada’s Knotia"><img src="/assets/images/icons/tax_ca.jpg" /></a> . </p>
                            <p> Generally, subsection 74.5(2) provides an exemption from the attribution rules in subsections 74.1(1) and 74.2(1) for loans of property that bear a commercial interest rate. For the purposes of subsection 74.5(2)
                                <a title="Wolters Kluwer’s Intelliconnect" target="_blank" href="http://admin.intelliconnect.ca/public/linkRouter.ashx?pubid=Canadian%20Income%20Tax%20Act&amp;xref=ITA%2074.5(2)" class="ITA" alt="Wolters Kluwer’s Intelliconnect"><img src="/assets/images/icons/intelliconnect_ca.jpg" /></a>
                                <a title="CPA Canada’s Knotia" target="_blank" href="http://www.tax.ca/qf/ITA%2074.5(2)?sid=CTF" class="CICA" alt="CPA Canada’s Knotia"><img src="/assets/images/icons/tax_ca.jpg" /></a> , a loan is considered to bear a commercial interest rate if interest is charged at a rate not less than either the prescribed rate in effect when the loan was made or the rate that would have been agreed on between arm's-length parties in similar circumstances. There is no attribution of income or gains from property acquired with loaned funds if the interest payable on the loan for that year and each preceding year has been paid not later than 30 days after the end of each year. A transferor may elect out of the subsection 73(1) spousal rollover so that a transfer occurs at FMV. </p>
                            <p> The TI considers a situation in which an individual (Mr. X) owned and sold shares of a CCPC that were &quot;qualified small business corporation shares&quot; as defined in subsection 110.6(1)
                                <a title="Wolters Kluwer’s Intelliconnect" target="_blank" href="http://admin.intelliconnect.ca/public/linkRouter.ashx?pubid=Canadian%20Income%20Tax%20Act&amp;xref=ITA%20110.6(1)" class="ITA" alt="Wolters Kluwer’s Intelliconnect"><img src="/assets/images/icons/intelliconnect_ca.jpg" /></a>
                                <a title="CPA Canada’s Knotia" target="_blank" href="http://www.tax.ca/qf/ITA%20110.6(1)?sid=CTF" class="CICA" alt="CPA Canada’s Knotia"><img src="/assets/images/icons/tax_ca.jpg" /></a> . The capital gain arising on the disposition of the shares qualified for the capital gains exemption. The proceeds from the sale of the shares were placed in a non-registered joint investment account with Mrs. X for the purpose of acquiring and holding financial instruments (such as bonds and mutual funds). </p>
                            <p> One issue in the TI is whether all the capital gains and other income earned in the joint account would be attributed back to Mr. X, unless Mr. X makes a prescribed rate loan to Mrs. X. </p>
                            <p> In its response, the CRA says that the attribution rules generally would not apply if Mr. X loaned funds to Mrs. X and charged interest on the loan at a rate equal to or greater than the lesser of the prescribed rate that was in effect at the time the loan was made and the rate that would have been agreed on, at the time the loan was made, between parties dealing with each other at arm's length. However, the CRA notes that it is a question of fact whether the spousal attribution rules apply. The CRA says that it can decide whether the attribution rules apply only on a case-by-case basis, including a review of all the pertinent information. Resolving this question requires an analysis of all of the facts surrounding the acquisition of the portfolio of income-producing investments. </p>
                            <p> The CRA cautions that the reverse attribution rule (which prevents using the attribution rules to reduce tax) in subsection 74.5(11)

                                <a title="Wolters Kluwer’s Intelliconnect" target="_blank" href="http://admin.intelliconnect.ca/public/linkRouter.ashx?pubid=Canadian%20Income%20Tax%20Act&amp;xref=ITA%20245" class="ITA" alt="Wolters Kluwer’s Intelliconnect"><img src="/assets/images/icons/intelliconnect_ca.jpg" /></a>

                            <p> The CRA's comments on GAAR may be a response to the attribution rules in general rather than to prescribed rate loans in particular. The CRA may be mindful of the SCC's decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lipson</span><span style="font-style:normal;"> (<a title="2009 SCC 1" target="_blank" href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc1/2009scc1.html" class="Web" alt="2009 SCC 1"><img>2009 SCC 1</img></a>), in which GAAR applied to deny the taxpayer an interest deduction following a series of transactions designed to convert non-deductible home mortgage interest payments into deductible interest payments on money borrowed to purchase shares.</span> </p>
